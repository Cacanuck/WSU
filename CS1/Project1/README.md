Project 1

## Project Description
---
Project prompts the user 5 times asking for each answer to be a different data type:
    * Int
    * String
    * Char
    * Boolean
    * Double

The project ensures the programmer can detect and differentiate between several different types of data, and write code that allows for some outliers to be considered as well.

## Lessons Learned

What I learned creating this project was:
    1. How to create a new Scanner object to be able to read different data types.
    2. How to use ``` .equalsIgnoreCase()``` to ensure that all capitalization is ignored.
    3. How to use ``` .charAt()``` to ensure that only a specific character is read.
    4. Practice using if/else statements.
