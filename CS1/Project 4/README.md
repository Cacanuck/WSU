# Project Title
---
Project 4 Catacomb Crawler

## Project Description
---
Project helps to teach object oriented programming, as well as tie together all other topics learned through the semester, such as:
1. Loops
2. Arrays
3. Methods
4. If/Else statements
5. Documentation

## Project Guide
---

### Dependencies
---
The user needs to have any program to run Java code, such as VisualStudioCode

### How to run the project
---
The user needs to open the project, and either select run from the menu at the top left of the screen, or the run arrow at the top right of the application.

### How to play the game
---
The user is tasked with helping the Hero escape from the catacomb maze.  The program will give the user prompts on how to act, and the user must make decisions based on the prompts and information that the program provides in response to those prompts in order to get the Hero to safety.
## Lessons Learned
---
* Object classes and their methods, and how to call them and store the information
* Loops that run multiple calculations at a time to provide the user with information
* Code to make sure that any errant inputs from the user is either ignored completely or changed to be usable

### Bugs I encountered
---
* Game was not placing monsters into the maze at all
* Game was not running combat between the Hero and Monster even if they were in the same room
* Hero was not taking damage after moving
* Combat was being infinitely looped
