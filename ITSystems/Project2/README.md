## Description
Project 2 creates a full stack using a CloudFormation file.  The file is intended to make the creating of a full stack much faster than having to manually click and interact with the different interfaces in the VPC menu of AWS.  The file first tasks for a description of the stack that is to be created, and ensures that the VPC created will have a corresponding key pair available.  It then needs an AMI and region to be specified, to make sure that the instance inside the VPC has a correct and desired operating system.  The file will then create a VPC with the specified CIDR Block.  It then creates a subnet within the VPC.  The file then creates an Internet gateway, and attaches it to the VPC to ensure that the VPC can contact the Internet.  A Route Table is then created, as well as a route to send all external traffic to the Internet Gateway.  The Route Table is then associated with the Subnet.  The file then creates an Elastic IP, which is a public IP address that will not be released when the VPC is off.  A security group is then created to , with rules to allow SSH access to the VPC from a home IP address, the Wright State IP block, internal SSH from other potential instances inside the VPC, and HTTP access from anywhere.  Then a Network ACL is created to control inbound network traffic, which has default rule sto allow all traffic on all ports to come in and out, and then has an additional rule to block outbound traffic from connecting to the public IP address for wttr.in.  An Ubuntu Instance is then created, selecting all of the hardware and creating a private IP address for that instance within the Subnet.  Finally, a bash script is set to run that installs several different packages, changes the hostname of the instance, downloads a wordle script from the internet, and replaces the default index.html file in apache2 to a file downloaded from the internet.

The Internet Gateway is attached to the VPC. The Route Table is attacked to the Subnet.  The Elastic Public IP and the Security Groups are attached to the Instance.
