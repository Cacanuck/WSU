            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout model
              designed to provide an efficient way to arrange items within a
              container. It is particularly useful for creating flexible and
              responsive designs, making it easier to align and distribute space
              among items. Flexbox simplifies tasks like vertically centering
              elements or evenly distributing space, tasks that were previously
              more complex using traditional layout methods like floats or
              positioning.

            <h3>The Flex Container and Flex Items</h3>
            <p>
              In Flexbox, a parent element is designated as the flex container,
              and its children are referred to as flex items. The container's
              display property is set to display: flex;, which immediately
              applies the Flexbox layout to its children. This allows the items
              within the container to align, grow, shrink, and wrap as needed,
              depending on the available space and the styling rules applied.

            <h1>Flex Direction</h1>
            <p>
              The flex-direction property controls the direction in which flex
              items are placed within the flex container. By default, items are
              arranged in a row from left to right, but this can be changed to
              column layout using flex-direction: column;. Additionally, reverse
              options (row-reverse and column-reverse) are available to flip the
              item order either horizontally or vertically.

            <h3>Justify Content</h3>
            <p>
              The justify-content property is used to align flex items along the
              main axis (which can be horizontal or vertical depending on
              flex-direction). This property helps in controlling the space
              distribution between items. Common values include flex-start,
              flex-end, center, space-between, and space-around, each affecting
              how items are spaced within the container.

            <h3>Align Items and Align Content</h3>
            <p>
              While justify-content controls alignment along the main axis,
              align-items manages alignment along the cross axis (perpendicular
              to the main axis). This allows you to align flex items at the
              start, center, or end of the cross axis. For multi-line flex
              containers, align-content manages the alignment of the lines
              themselves, allowing for vertical spacing adjustments when items
              wrap into multiple rows.

            <h3>Flex Grow, Shrink, and Basis</h3>
            <p>
              Flexbox offers precise control over the size of flex items using
              the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties. flex-grow
              defines how much an item should expand relative to other items in
              the container, while flex-shrink determines how items should
              shrink if space becomes limited. flex-basis sets the initial size
              of a flex item before it grows or shrinks, giving you granular
              control over item sizes.

            <h3>Flexbox and Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>
              Flexbox is an excellent tool for creating responsive layouts that
              adapt to various screen sizes. By adjusting properties like
              flex-wrap, you can control whether items wrap onto new lines when
              the container shrinks. Combined with media queries, Flexbox helps
              ensure your layout remains flexible and usable across different
              devices, making it a go-to solution for modern web
